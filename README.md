# Cloud Function Documentation - GPT-API

## Overview
This cloud function, named `helloHttp`, is designed to interact with the OpenAI GPT API. It accepts POST requests containing specific user and system content, processes it, and sends it to the OpenAI GPT API to generate a response based on the input.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed along with npm.
- An active Google Cloud project with the Functions Framework (`@google-cloud/functions-framework`).
- Axios (`axios`) for making HTTP requests.
- An API key for the OpenAI GPT service, stored in the environment variable `SECRET_KEY`.

## API Endpoint: `helloHttp`

### Request
- **Method:** POST
- **Headers:**
  - Content-Type: application/json
- **Body:**
  - `content`: JSON object containing:

    - `user`: String representing the user's input.

### Response
- **Success:**
  - Status Code: `200`
  - Body: JSON object representing the response from the GPT model.
- **Errors:**
